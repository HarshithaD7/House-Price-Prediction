# House Price Prediction

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting house prices using supervised machine learning regression techniques.  
All experiments were conducted in a **Kaggle Notebook environment** using a real-world housing dataset.

Multiple regression models were trained and evaluated to identify the most accurate approach.

---

## Objectives
- Preprocess and analyze housing data
- Train multiple regression models
- Evaluate model performance using error metrics
- Identify the best-performing model for house price prediction

---

## Dataset
- Structured housing dataset
- Target variable: **House Sale Price**
- Validation-based evaluation approach

> Due to file size limitations, only sample datasets are included in the repository.  
> The full dataset is used directly within the Kaggle Notebook.

## Models Implemented
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- Random Forest Regressor

---

## Results Overview
- **SVR achieved the lowest prediction error with a MAPE of 18.70%**
- **Random Forest achieved a MAPE of 19.21%**
- Linear Regression showed comparatively weaker performance
